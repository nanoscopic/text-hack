- Allow the textual format to be converted back into a binary
- Add in a basic "diff" ability to see what was changed in the textual representation of a file
- Add a header to the textual representation so that the file itself has information showing what file
  it is a representation of.
- Add an option to split shown text up into nicely viewable lines
- Add an ability to do RLE for sequential hex bytes
- Add a configuration file with the ability to recognize certain sequence of bytes and show them in a readable way
  - Make it so this is completely reversible so any changes can be flowed back to the binary file
- Add the ability to recognize certain types of files and automatically use a useful set of rules to parse the files apart
- Allow multiple output format; specifically XML for more complex file formats
- Add the ability to detect and decompress embedded compressed data
- Add a Makefile
- Alter the code to use stdint.h instead of confusing "unsigned char" nonsense
- Add a command line option to use lowercase hex instead of uppercase
- Add an output format that renders files in the same way as they would basically be show in old DOS debug command
- Add an HTML visualization format that creates a nicely colorized rendered view of the binary data.
  - Make it so that the view is basically editable and resaveable via pure javascript
  
Done:
- Make the script properly accept data piped into it as well as read a named file in arguments
- Show usage when the script is run without any arguments
